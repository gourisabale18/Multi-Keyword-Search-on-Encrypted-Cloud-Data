# Multi-Keyword-Search-on-Encrypted-Cloud-Data
Multi-Keyword Search on Encrypted Cloud Data

The cloud computing treats computing as a utility and leases out the computing and storage capacities to the public individuals. In such a framework, the individual can remotely store her data on the cloud server, namely data outsourcing, and then make the cloud data open for public access through the cloud server. This represents a more scalable, low-cost and stable way for public data access because of the scalability and high efficiency of cloud servers, and therefore is favorable to small enterprises. The outsourced data may contain sensitive privacy information. It is often necessary to encrypt the private data before transmitting the data to the cloud servers. The data encryption, however, would significantly lower the usability of data due to the difficulty of searching over the encrypted data.
The Project provides a very easy solution to enable efficient search over encrypted files. The basic concept behind this project is to generate several keywords over outsourced data. These keywords are later encrypted and stored over the cloud server. When the search user needs to access the outsourced data, it can select some relevant words. These keywords are mapped onto the index file and returns files containing matching results to the search user.

Tech Stack Used:
1. Java/ Java Enterprise Applications
2. AWS (S3)
3. Javascript
4. JSP Pages
5. Encryption algorithms such as DSA
6. Index Building and Trapdoor generation concepts in cloud seurity
